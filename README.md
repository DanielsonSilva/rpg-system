# RPG System

This repository represents an extensible RPG System creator. It comes with interfaces to implements that has the most common actions in a RPG game. You can use the already systems created or you can extend to your own rules for creation.

This is an example of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern. First you choose which RPG Rule System you would like to use and then you can iteract using the methods in the Interface without knowing which the RPG System the user/player chose.

You are welcome to extend to new RPG Rule Systems.
